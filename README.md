# Introduction #

This repository contains the C++ implementation of the [Spread](https://www.spread.org)-based transport for the [Robotics Service Bus](https://github.com/open-rsx) middleware.

**The full documentation for RSB can be found at <https://docs.cor-lab.de/manual/rsb-trunk/index.html>.**

**This product uses software developed by Spread Concepts LLC for use in the Spread toolkit. For more information about Spread see <http://www.spread.org>.**

# Dependencies #

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build systen
- [Boost C++ libraries](https://www.boost.org/)
- [The RSC C++ library](https://github.com/open-rsx/rsc)
- [The C++ implementation of RSB](https://github.com/open-rsx/rsb-cpp)
- The C client library of the [Spread group communication framework](https://www.spread.org)

# Building and Installing #

This project uses the default CMake workflow (assuming the RSC and RSB libraries have already been installed into `<prefix>`):

```sh
cd <path to code>/build/
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix> ..
make
make test       # opt. run unit tests
make install    # install
```

<!-- To generate a coverage report chose `coverage` as CMake build type and do -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ```sh -->
<!-- make -->
<!-- make test -->
<!-- make coverage -->
<!-- ``` -->
